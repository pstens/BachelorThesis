	Abstract = {The floating action button (FAB) was popularized by the release of Google's Material Design
principles in 2014. Since this release, the FAB user interface component has been widely
adopted in web and mobile design. However, the effectiveness of the FAB has been a
controversial topic in the user experience design community. Albeit, there is no research based
evidence validating user experience implications of the FAB. This study addresses the user
experience implications of the FAB. Usability data was generated by employing industry
standard A/B user testing methods performed on both the FAB and a traditional action button as
a control. Comparison analysis of this data exhibited that the FAB component presented a slight
negative usability impact upon users first use of the button. However, after having used the FAB,
users repeated the action and the data demonstrated the FAB was more efficient. Once users had
successfully completed a task using the FAB, they were able to use it more efficiently than the
traditional action button.},

	Abstract = { Decision-making theories have argued that many daily decisions are the result of heuristic rather than systematic processes. Given the ubiquity of smartphones as mobile communication and computing devices along with the vast smartphone app market, our exploratory study aimed to understand how heuristics guide smartphone app selection. Observing 49 smartphone users from the US and Germany viewing 189 total apps from three predetermined categories, the current study identified five decision-making heuristics used to download a variety of smartphone apps. Of these, four were variants of a ``Take the First'' (TtF) heuristic that allowed smartphone users to quickly navigate the app market, by passing a good deal of other informational cues in order to download apps that were simply highly rated or ranked. Reliance on heuristic processing is useful in helping navigate the app market, but it also results in smartphone users overlooking potentially important app information. },
